# CoCoA - A Framework for Communication-Efficient Distributed Optimization

New! ProxCoCoA+ provides support for L1-regularized objectives. See [paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.04011) and [code](https://github.com/gingsmith/proxcocoa).

We've added support for faster additive udpates with CoCoA+. See more information [here](http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03508).

This code performs a comparison of 5 distributed algorithms for training of machine learning models, using [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org). The implemented algorithms are
 - _CoCoA+_
 - _CoCoA_
 - mini-batch stochastic dual coordinate ascent (_mini-batch SDCA_)
 - stochastic subgradient descent with local updates (_local SGD_)
 - mini-batch stochastic subgradient descent (_mini-batch SGD_)

The present code trains a standard SVM (hinge-loss, l2-regularized) using SDCA as a local solver, and reports training and test error, as well as the duality gap certificate if the method is primal-dual. The code can be easily adapted to include other internal solvers or solve other objectives.

## Getting Started
How to run the code locally:

```
sbt/sbt assembly
./run-demo-local.sh
```

(For the `sbt` script to run, make sure you have downloaded CoCoA into a directory whose path contains no spaces.)
